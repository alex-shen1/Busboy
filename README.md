# Busboy
Works with the TransLoc API to get info on UVA's bus service. Currently capable of pushing notifications to my phone via Pushbullet containing information on when buses are coming.

Currently not in active development, as COVID-19 forcing everyone off-Grounds means I can't really test run the program effectively.
